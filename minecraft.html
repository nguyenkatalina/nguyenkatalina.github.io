<h1>Recreating Rietveld's Red Blue Chair</h1>
<p>Using Minecraft To SHow Cultural Significance
<br>
CHALLENGE: The challenge was to use and "sandbox" 
environment to create a sculpture of cultural 
significance, and then 3D printing the results.
<br>
Solution: For my sculpture, I did Gerrit Rietveld's 
Red Blue Chair which was designed in 1918. Being in 
the interior design major, we see countless numbers 
of chairs and the way they have changed throughout 
the years as a result of different styles and 
ergonomic design choices. The colors of red, blue, 
and yellow as well as the horizontal and vertical 
symmetry represent the colors of the De Stijl movement, 
which valued abstraction and simplicity.</p>

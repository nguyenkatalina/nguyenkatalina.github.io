<h1>Pieces By The Hand</h1>
<p>An Art Kiosk Made For Handbuilt Pottery Pieces</p>

<img src="kiosk.png" alt="Kiosk">
<p>CHALLENGE: The design goal was to create a 
kiosk/booth that does not exceed a 10ft x 10ft x 10ft 
box.
<br>
SOLUTION: With this being one of the first projects 
I've done with using SketchUp, I wanted to create a 
space that would be compact, but could also expand 
into a bigger area for different things, whether that 
means for display or for purchasing items.</p>

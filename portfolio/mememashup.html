<h1>Meme Mashup</h1>
<p>CHALLENGE: The challenge for this project was to 
create something meaningful and new from two or more 
sources, specifically memes.
<br>
SOLUTION: My solution was to use the meme about 
Rihanna's halftime show as a site for a Super Smash 
Bros arena with Rihanna winning and Spiderman and a 
French guy from a painting losing against her.</p>

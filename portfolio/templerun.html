<h1>Temple Run</h1>
<p>Spatial Intervention | Additive Planes</p>

<img src="start.png" alt="Temple Run">

<p>CHALLENGE: The design goal of this project is to 
create new ways for visitors to engage with a historic
 site space. The design has to consist of a path 
 through a portion of the site and vertical planes
 that define different spatial experiences along 
 the path.</p>

<br>

<p>SOLUTION: The design entails a interactive path all
 around the site of the temple, with elements of a 
 playground to keep it fun while visitors tour around 
 the site. The colored structures that are in color 
 represent the different size groups in addition the 
 the fun elements that were included in the design.</p>

<p>SITE: TEMPLE OF KUKULKAN
For the design, there are several focal points that 
the pathway includes. From the temple as a whole to 
specific elements on the temple to the surrounding 
monuments around the temple, the design overlooks the 
many aspects of the temple that visitors come for.</p>

<p>INSPIRATION AND CONCEPT
<br>
The design was inspired by the idea of finding your 
inner child that loves to explore. There are elements 
that are inspired by curiosity and movement that 
connects the path as a whole.
<br>
The concept follows that of a playground and obstacle 
course with a central hub that branches off and leads 
to three different options: one to go to the very top 
of the templeâ€‹, one to explore the sides more, and one 
to make the final descent down.</p>

<p>PLANS AND DIAGRAMS
<br>
This section includes the floor plan and sections 
that show how the path connects as well as what the 
colored sections stand for.</p>

<p>AXONOMETRIC VIEWS
<br>
These images show the pathway connections as well as 
the dynamic flow of the pathway. The hub is shown as 
the central area that is then branched out to 
different option that the visitors can take.</p>

<p>KEY ASPECTS
<br>
Here you can see different parts of the path in 
perspective to see how visitors would walk along 
this path. The different structures can be seen to 
give more of an idea on how visitors would move from 
start to finish.</p>

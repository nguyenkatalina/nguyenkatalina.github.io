<h1>Stop And Take A Break</h1>
<p>CHALLENGE: The challenge was to create and connect 
a series of pages around a topic, story, or experience, 
with using links, images, and pages to tell the story 
in a modern, hypertext, yet poetic way.
<br>
SOLUTION: My website takes its user and tells them to 
take a break. In a busy world where we are always 
doing something and thinking about something, we 
often need reminders that it's time for a break. 
This site runs through options you can take for your 
break, from breathing to taking a walk, to 
reprioritizing. It's very important to just unclench 
your jaw once in a while to relax.

<h1>Glitch</h1>
<p>CHALLENGE: The challenge for this project was to 
use opensource and other software to create and 
control glitches in images.
<br>
SOLUTION: By using data moshing and data bending, 
I was able to create a variety of glitches. My theme 
for this assignment lies along the lines of the 
different ways people view food. This includes foods 
that are healthy versus unhealthy, foods that are 
genetically modified to be perfect, and all the other 
ways foods are controlled. Whether the food is 
healthy, unhealthy, processed, organic, genetically 
modified, etc., it's okay to eat the food you want to.
 Foods labeled as GMOs or organic shouldn't define 
 the things that you eat, but it is how you choose to
 eat as a whole that affects you and how your body 
 feels, mentally and physically.</p>

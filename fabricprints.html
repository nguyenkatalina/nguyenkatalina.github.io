<h1>Fabric Prints</h1>
<p>Visual Manipulation
<br>
CHALLENGE: The design goal was to create fabric 
patterns using illustrator and photoshop to draw and 
trace objects (one being a body part and the other 
two being random objects. 
<br>
SOLUTION: By manipulating the size, scale, color, line
 weights, opacity, etc., I was able to design three 
 different patterns with the same three objects.

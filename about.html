<h1>A little about me!</h1>
<br>
<h2>I'M KATALINA NGUYEN!</h2>
<p>
I'm currently a student studying interior design. This wasn't always my plan as I was originally a 
business major who switched to mechanical engineering. Interior design was a career choice always 
at the back of my mind, but never came to light because of the unsure financial security that would 
come with it. I eventually came to the realization that I wasn't happy with where I was in my life 
and decided to make the full transition into focusing on a career in interior design. The field is 
still so broad and new to me, but that is the fun of having such a career.</p>

<h2>WHAT DO I BELIEVE IN?</h2>

â€‹<p>I strive to be able to create spaces where the memories are made to last. These memories will live 
beyond that of the space itself so that people can remember pieces of their lives even when a space 
has changed or is no longer there. Whether simple with minimal furniture or complex with many colors, 
I want these spaces to invoke a feeling of comfort as people begin to experience a space. I believe in 
functionality in the things and spaces I create and work in. This being said I want to design things meant 
to be used daily with practicality in mind. My designs will involve creating a space for people to show their 
personalities while considering comfort and functionality.</p>

<p>EDUCATION: San Jose State University - BA Design Studies (Interior Design)
<br>
EXPERIENCE / SKILLS

SketchUp, Enscape, Revit, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office</p>
